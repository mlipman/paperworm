It is a rare peasant who, once \"promoted\" to overseer, does not become more of a tyrant towards his former comrades than the owner him-self. This is because the context of the peasant's situation, that is, oppression, remains unchanged.

In this sense, the praxis is the new raison d'etre of the oppressed; and the revolution, which inaugurates the historical moment of this raison d'etre, is not viable apart from their concomi-tant conscious involvement. Otherwise, action is pure activism. ",

It is argued that feminist studies can, in theory, use modern critical theories of how meanings & bodies get made; the power of these theories would then be used to build lifelike meanings & \"bodies,\" (defined as \"a finite point of view\"), rather than deny them, as often done in nonfeminist theories. Feminist objectivity, therefore, is defined as a highly positive vision of the existing reality. This vision presupposes partial, locatable critical knowledges sustaining the possibility of interrelations between elements, eg, shared epistemology. Based on the view from the body, which is described as complex, contradictory, structuring, & structured, feminist objectivity is thus opposed to relativism & simplicity. The body is also considered as the key goal of the proposed situated knowledges. Since these knowledges require that their object be pictured as actor & agent, the essential agentivity of the body is posited. M. Polinsky",

The imagined \"they\" constitute a kind of invisible conspiracy of masculinist scientists and philosophers replete with grants and laboratories. The imagined \"we\" are the embodied others, who are not allowed not to have a body, a finite point of view, and so an inevitably disqualifying and polluting bias in any discussion of consequence outside our own little circles, where a \"mass\"-subscription journal might reach a few thousand readers composed mostly of science haters. At least, I confess to these paranoid fantasies and academic resentments lurking under- neath some convoluted reflections in print under my name in the feminist literature in the history and philosophy of science. We, the feminists in the debates about science and technology, are the Reagan era's \"special-interest groups\" in the rarified realm of epistemology, where traditionally what can count as knowledge is policed by philosophers codifying cognitive canon law. Of course, a special-interest group is, by Reaganoid definition, any collective historical subject that dares to resist the stripped-down atomism of Star Wars, hypermarket, postmodern, media-simulated citizen- ship.

Certainly I speak for myself here, and I offer the speculation that there is a collective discourse on these matters. Recent social studies of science and technology, for example, have made available a very strong social constructionist argument for all forms of knowledge claims, most certainly and especially scientific ones.' According to these tempt- ing views, no insider's perspective is privileged, because all draw- ings of inside-outside boundaries in knowledge are theorized as power moves, not moves toward truth. So, from the strong social constructionist perspective, why should we be cowed by scien- tists' descriptions of their activity and accomplishments; they and their patrons have stakes in throwing sand in our eyes. They tell parables about objectivity and scientific method to students in the first years of their initiation, but no practitioner of the high scien- tific arts would be caught dead acting on the textbook versions. Social constructionists make clear that official ideologies about ob- jectivity and scientific method are particularly bad guides to how scientific knowledge is actually made. Just as for the rest of us, what scientists believe or say they do and what they really do have a very loose fit.",

Such persuasions must take account of the struc- ture of facts and artifacts, as well as of language-mediated actors in the knowledge game. Here, artifacts and facts are parts of the powerful art of rhetoric. Practice is persuasion, and the focus is very much on practice. All knowledge is a condensed node in an agonistic power field.

But Marxism was still a promising resource as a kind of epistemological feminist mental hygiene that sought our own doctrines of objective vision. Marxist starting points offered a way to get to our own versions of stand- point theories, insistent embodiment, a rich tradition of critiquing hegemony without disempowering positivisms and relativisms and a way to get to nuanced theories of mediation.

What money does in the exchange orders of capitalism, reductionism does in the powerful mental orders of global sciences. There is, finally, only one equation. That is the deadly fantasy that feminists and others have identified in some versions of objectivity, those in the service of hierarchical and positivist orderings of what can count as knowledge. That is one of the reasons the debates about objectivity matter, metaphorically and otherwise. Immortality and omnipotence are not our goals. But we could use some enforceable, reliable accounts of things not reduci- ble to power moves and agonistic, high-status games of rhetoric or to scientistic, positivist arrogance. This point applies whether we are talking about genes, social classes, elementary particles, genders, races, or texts; the point applies to the exact, natural, social, and human sciences, despite the slippery ambiguities of the words \"objectivity\" and \"science\" as we slide around the discursive terrain. In our efforts to climb the greased pole leading to a usable doctrine of objectivity, I and most other feminists in the objectivity debates have alternatively, or even simultaneously, held on to both ends of the dichotomy, a dichotomy which Harding des- cribes in terms of successor science projects versus postmodernist accounts of difference and which I have sketched in this essay as radical constructivism versus feminist critical empiricism. It is, of course, hard to climb when you are holding on to both ends of a pole, simultaneously or alternatively. It is, therefore, time to switch metaphors.",

That is, admitted or not, politics and ethics ground struggles over knowledge projects in the exact, natural, social, and human sciences. Otherwise, rationality is simply impossible, an optical illusion projected from nowhere comprehensively. Histories of science may be powerfully told as histories of the technologies. These technologies are ways of life, social orders, practices of visualization. Technologies are skilled practices. How to see? Where to see from? What limits to vision? What to see for? Whom to see with? Who gets to have more than one point of view? Who gets blinded? Who wears blinders? Who interprets the visual field? What other sensory powers do we wish to cultivate besides vision? Moral and political discourse should be the paradigm for rational discourse about the imagery and technol- ogies of vision.

A map of tensions and reason- ances between the fixed ends of a charged dichotomy better repre- sents the potent politics and epistemologies of embodied, there- fore accountable, objectivity. For example, local knowledges have also to be in tension with the productive structurings that force unequal translations and exchanges - material and semiotic - with- in the webs of knowledge and power. Webs can have the property of being systematic, even of being centrally structured global systems with deep filaments and tenacious tendrils into time, space, and consciousness, which are the dimensions of world history. Feminist accountability requires a knowledge tuned to reasonance, not to dichotomy. Gender is a field of structured and structuring difference, in which the tones of extreme localization, of the intimately personal and individualized body, vibrate in the same field with global high-tension emissions. Feminist embodi- ment, then, is not about fixed location in a reified body, female or otherwise, but about nodes in fields, inflections in orientations, and responsibility for difference in material-semiotic fields of meaning. Embodiment is significant prosthesis; objectivity cannot be about fixed vision when what counts as an object is precisely what world history turns out to be about.",

A splitting of senses, a confusion of voice and sight, rather than clear and distinct ideas, becomes the metaphor for the ground of the rational.

We seek those ruled by partial sight and limited voice-not partiality for its own sake but, rather, for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings situated knowl- edges make possible. Situated knowledges are about communities, not about isolated individuals. The only way to find a larger vision is to be somewhere in particular. The science question in femi- nism is about objectivity as positioned rationality. Its images are not the products of escape and transcendence of limits (the view from above) but the joining of partial views and halting voices into a collective subject position that promises a vision of the means of ongoing finite embodiment, of living within limits and contradic- tions-of views from somewhere.",

Here, the object both guarantees and refreshes the power of the knower, but any status as agent in the productions of knowledge must be denied the object. It -the world - must, in short, be objec- tified as a thing, not as an agent; it must be matter for the self- formation of the only social being in the productions of knowl- edge, the human knower. Zoe Sofoulis19 identified the structure of this mode of knowing in technoscience as \"resourcing\" - as the sec- ond birthing of Man through the homogenizing of all the world's body into resource for his perverse projects. Nature is only the raw material of culture, appropriated, preserved, enslaved, ex- alted, or otherwise made flexible for disposal by culture in the logic of capitalist colonialism. Similarly, sex is only matter to the act of gender; the productionist logic seems inescapable in tradi- tions of Western binary oppositions. This analytical and historical narrative logic accounts for my nervousness about the sex/gender distinction in the recent history of feminist theory. Sex is \"re- sourced\" for its representation as gender, which \"we\" can control. It has seemed all but impossible to avoid the trap of an appropria- tionist logic of domination built into the nature/culture opposition and its generative lineage, including the sex/gender distinction.",

I refer to the reconstructions in primatology (especially, but not only, in women's practice as primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and behavioral ecologists) of what may count as sex, especially as female sex, in scientific accounts.20 The body, the object of biological discourse, becomes a most engaging being. Claims of biological determinism can never be the same again. When female \"sex\"' has been so thoroughly retheorized and revisualized that it emerges as practically indistinguishable from \"mind,\" something basic has happened to the categories of biology. The biological female peopling current biological behavioral accounts has almost no passive properties left. She is structuring and active in every respect; the \"body\" is an agent, not a resource. Difference is theorized biologically as situational, not intrinsic, at every level from gene to foraging pattern, thereby fundamentally changing the biological politics of the body. The relations between sex and gender need to be categorically reworked within these frames of knowledge. I would like to suggest that this trend in explanatory strategies in biology is an allegory for interventions faithful to pro- jects of feminist objectivity. The point is not that these new pic- tures of the biological female are simply true or not open to con- testation and conversation - quite the opposite. But these pictures foreground knowledge as situated conversation at every level of its articulation. The boundary between animal and human is one of the stakes in this allegory, as is the boundary between machine and organism.",

In her analysis of the production of the poem as an object of literary value, Katie King offers tools that clarify matters in the objectivity debates among feminists. King suggests the term \"apparatus of literary production\" to refer to the emergence of literature at the in- tersection of art, business, and technology. The apparatus of literary production is a matrix from which \"literature\" is born. Focusing on the potent object of value called the \"poem,\" King ap- plies her analytic framework to the relation of women and writing technologies.21 I would like to adapt her work to understanding the generation-the actual production and reproduction-of bodies and other objects of value in scientific knowledge projects. At first glance, there is a limitation to using King's scheme inherent in the \"facticity\" of biological discourse that is absent from literary discourse and its knowledge claims. Are biological bodies \"pro- duced\" or \"generated\" in the same strong sense as poems? From the early stirrings of Romanticism in the late eighteenth century, many poets and biologists have believed that poetry and or- ganisms are siblings. Frankenstein may be read as a meditation on this proposition. I continue to believe in this potent proposition but in a postmodern and not a Romantic manner. I wish to trans- late the ideological dimensions of \"facticity\" and \"the organic\" into a cumbersome entity called a \"material-semiotic actor.\" This un- wieldy term is intended to portray the object of knowledge as an active, meaning-generating part of apparatus of bodily production, without ever implying the immediate presence of such objects or, what is the same thing, their final or unique determination of what can count as objective knowledge at a particular historical junc- ture. Like \"poems,\" which are sites of literary production where language too is an actor independent of intentions and authors, bodies as objects of knowledge are material-semiotic generative nodes. Their boundaries materialize in social interaction. Boun- daries are drawn by mapping practices; \"objects\" do not preexist as such. Objects are boundary projects. But boundaries shift from within; boundaries are very tricky. What boundaries provisionally contain remains generative, productive of meanings and bodies. Siting (sighting) boundaries is a risky practice.",

Latour is not otherwise a notable feminist theorist, but he might be made into one by readings as perverse as those he makes of the laboratory, that great machine for making significant mistakes faster than anyone else can, and so gaining world-changing power. The laboratory for Latour is the railroad industry of epistemology, where facts can only be made to run on the tracks laid down from the laboratory out.

                "text":"Aspects of the debates about modernism and postmodernism affect feminist analyses of the problem of \"objectivity.\" Mapping the fault line between modernism and post- modernism in ethnography and anthropology-in which the high stakes are the authorization or prohibition to craft comparative knowledge across \"cultures\"- Marilyn Strathern made the crucial observation that it is not the written ethnography that is parallel to the work of art as object-of-knowledge, but the culture. The Romantic and modernist natural-technical objects of knowledge, in science and in other cultural prac- tice, stand on one side of this divide. The postmodernist formation stands on the other side, with its \"anti-aesthetic\" of permanently split, problematized, always receding and deferred \"objects\" of knowledge and practice, including signs, organisms, systems, selves, and cultures. \"Objectivity\" in a postmodern framework cannot be about un- problematic objects; it must be about specific prosthesis and always partial translations. At root, objectivity is about crafting comparative knowledge: How may a community name things to be stable and to be like each other? In postmodernism, this query translates into a question of the politics of redrawing of boundaries in order to have non-innocent conversations and connections. What is at stake in the debates about modernism and postmodernism is the pattern of relationships between and within bodies and language. This is a crucial matter for feminists.

John Varley's science fiction short story, \"The Persistence of Vision,\" in The Per- sistence of Vision (New York: Dell, 1978), 263-316, is part of the inspiration for this sec- tion. In the story, Varley constructs a utopian community designed and built by the deaf-blind. He then explores these people's technologies and other mediations of com- munication and their relations to sighted children and visitors. In the story, \"Blue Champagne,\" in Blue Champagne (New York: Berkeley, 1986), 17-79, Varley transmutes the theme to interrogate the politics of intimacy and technology for a paraplegic young woman whose prosthetic device, the golden gypsy, allows her full mobility. But because the infinitely costly device is owned by an intergalactic communications and entertainment empire, for which she works as a media star making \"feelies,\" she may keep her technological, intimate, enabling, other self only in exchange for her complici- ty in the commodification of all experience. What are her limits to the reinvention of ex- perience for sale? Is the personal political under the sign of simulation? One way to read Varley's repeated investigations of finally always limited embodiments, differently abled beings, prosthetic technologies, and cyborgian encounters with their finitude, despite their extraordinary transcendence of \"organic\" orders, is to find an allegory for the personal and political in the historical mythic time of the late twentieth century, the era of techno-biopolitics. Prosthesis becomes a fundamental category for understanding our most intimate selves. Prosthesis is semiosis, the making of meanings and bodies, not for transcendence, but for power-charged communication.",

In The Science Question in Feminism (p. 18), Harding suggests that gender has three dimensions, each historically specific: gender symbolism, the social-sexual division of labor, and processes of constructing individual gendered identity. I would enlarge her point to note that there is no reason to expect the three dimensions to covary or codeter- mine each other, at least not directly. That is, extremely steep gradients between con- trasting terms in gender symbolism may very well not correlate with sharp social-sexual divisions of labor or social power, but they may be closely related to sharp racial stratification or something else. Similarly, the processes of gendered subject formation may not be directly illuminated by knowledge of the sexual division of labor or the ",

The mediations might move through quite different social axes of organization of both symbols, prac- tice, and identity, such as race-and vice versa. I would suggest also that science, as well as gender or race, might be usefully broken up into such a multipart scheme of symbolism, social practice, and subject position. More than three dimensions suggest themselves when the parallels are drawn. The different dimensions of, for example, gender, race and science might mediate relations among dimensions on a parallel chart. That is, racial divisions of labor might mediate the patterns of connection between sym- bolic connections and formation of individual subject positions on the science or gender chart. Or formations of gendered or racial subjectivity might mediate the relations be- tween scientific social division of labor and scientific symbolic patterns.",

In the chart (and in reality?), both gender and science are analytically asymmetrical; that is, each term con- tains and obscures a structuring hierarchicalized binary opposition, sex/gender and nature/science. Each binary opposition orders the silent term by a logic of appropria- tion, as resource to product, nature to culture, potential to actual. Both poles of the op- position are constructed and structure each other dialectically. Within each voiced or explicit term, further asymmetrical splittings can be excavated, as from gender, masculine to feminine, and from science, hard sciences to soft sciences. This is a point about remembering how a particular analytical tool works, willy-nilly, intended or not. The chart reflects common ideological aspects of discourse on science and gender and may help as an analytical tool to crack open mystified units like Science or Woman.",

Trusted friends and family, called strong ties, can affect emotional health [36] and often join together to lead organizations through times of crisis [24]. Despite many compelling findings along this line of research, social media does not incorporate tie strength or its lessons. Instead, all users are the same: friend or stranger, with little or nothing in between. Most empirical work examining large-scale social phenomena follows suit. A link between actors either exists or not, with the relationship having few properties of its own [1, 2, 27]. This paper aims to bridge the gap, merging the theory behind tie strength with the data behind social media. We address one central question. With theory as a guide, can social media data predict tie strength? This is more than a methodological or theoretical point; a model of tie strength has the potential to significantly impact social media users. Consider automatically allowing the friends of strong ties to access your profile. Or, as one participant cleverly suggested, remaking Facebook’s Newsfeed to get rid of “people from high school I don't give a crap about.” The model we present builds on a dataset of over 2,000 Facebook friendships, each assessed for tie strength and described by more than 70 numeric indicators. It performs with surprising accuracy, modeling tie strength to 10-point resolution and correctly classifying friends as strong or weak ties more than 85% of the time. We begin by reviewing the principles behind tie strength, and then discuss its proposed dimensions. Using theory to guide the selection of predictive variables, we next present the construction of our tie strength model. It performs well, but not perfectly. To understand our model’s limitations, we also present the results of follow-up interviews about the friendships we had the most difficulty predicting. The paper concludes by applying our findings toward implications for theory and practice.",

Consider the recent practice of substituting social media friends for traditional job references. As one hiring manager remarked, by using social media “you’ve opened up your rolodex for the whole world to see” [38]. To the dismay of applicants, employers sometimes cold call social media friends expecting a job reference “only to find that you were just drinking buddies.” Although clearly not the norm, the story illustrates a basic fact: not all relationships are created equal. For decades, social science has made much the same case, documenting how different types of relationships impact individuals and organizations [16]. In this line of research, relationships are measured in the currency of tie strength [17]. Loose acquaintances, known as weak ties, can help a",

Definition and Impact The strength of a tie is a (probably linear) combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie. [17] The Dimensions of Tie Strength At what point is a tie to be considered weak? This is not simply a question for the methodologically curious … the theory makes a curvilinear prediction. How do we know where we are on this theoretical curve? Do all four indicators count equally toward tie strength? [23]",

                "text":"While Granovetter left the precise definition of tie strength to future work, he did characterize two types of ties, strong and weak. Strong ties are the people you really trust, people whose social circles tightly overlap with your own. Often, they are also the people most like you. The young, the highly educated and the metropolitan tend to have diverse networks of strong ties [31]. Weak ties, conversely, are merely acquaintances. Weak ties often provide access to novel information, information not circulating in the closely knit network of strong ties. Many researchers have adopted tie strength as an analytic framework for studying individuals and organizations [16]. (Google Scholar, for instance, claims that over 7,000 papers cite “The Strength of Weak Ties” [15].) The social support offered by strong ties can actually improve mental health [36]. Banks that find the right mix of weak and strong ties to other firms tend to get better financial deals [39]. It has also been shown that weak ties, as opposed to strong ones, benefit job-seekers [18]. However, socioeconomic class reverses this effect: job-seekers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often rely heavily on strong ties [16]. Strong ties between employees from different organizational subunits can help an organization withstand a time of crisis [24]. Yet, strongly tied coworkers are also the ones likely to create crises by pushing for institutional change [23]. Employees who weakly tie themselves beyond organizational boundaries tend to receive better performance reviews and generate more creative ideas [4]. Weak ties also act as a conduit for useful information in computermediated communication [8]. However, weak ties often rely on a few commonly available media [22], whereas strong ties diversify, communicating through many channels [21].",

Ronald Burt proposed that structural factors shape tie strength, factors like network topology and informal social circles [5]. Wellman and Wortley argue that providing emotional support, such as offering advice on family problems, indicates a stronger tie [40]. Nan Lin, et al., show that social distance, embodied by factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, political affiliation, race and gender, influences tie strength [29]. In theory, tie strength has at least seven dimensions and many manifestations. In practice, relatively simple proxies have substituted for it: communication reciprocity [11], possessing at least one mutual friend [37], recency of communication [28] and interaction frequency [13, 17]. In a 1984 study, Peter Marsden used survey data from three metropolitan areas to precisely unpack the predictors of tie strength [33]. While quite useful, Marsden pointed out a key limitation of his work: the survey asked participants to recall only their three closest friends along with less than ten characteristics of the friendship. The present research can be seen as updating Marsden’s work for the era of social media. Our work differs primarily in setting and scale. By leveraging social media, participants no longer have to recall; we can take advantage of long friend lists and rich interaction histories. In this way, our work also overcomes the problem of retrospective informant accuracy [3, 30, 32]. In addition, a tie strength model built from social media has the potential to feed back into social media, in ways that benefit its users.",

Our goal was to collect data about the friendships that could act, in some combination, as a predictor for tie strength. Working in our lab, we used the Firefox extension Greasemonkey [19] to guide participants through a randomly selected subset of their Facebook friends. (Randomly sampling participants’ friends guards against those with large networks dominating the results.) The Greasemonkey script injected five tie strength questions into each friend’s profile after the page loaded in the browser. Figure 1 shows how a profile appeared to a participant. Participants answered the questions for as many friends as possible during one 30-minute session. On average, participants rated 62.4 friends ( = 16.2), resulting in a dataset of 2,184 rated Facebook friendships. Social media experiments often employ completely automated data collection. We worked in the lab for two important reasons. First, we captured all data at the client side, after a page loaded at the user’s request. This allowed us to stay within Facebook’s Terms of Service. More importantly, however, we asked participants to give us sensitive information: their relationship strengths plus personal Facebook data. We collected data in the lab to guard our participants’ privacy and to increase the accuracy of their responses.",

In the equations above, si represents the tie strength of the ith friend. Ri stands for the vector of 67 individual predictive variables. εi is the error term. Di represents the pairwise interactions between the dimensions presented in Table 1. Pairwise interactions are commonly included in predictive models [12]; in this case, including all pairwise interactions would force more variables than data points into the model. Instead, we nominated variables with the fewest missing values to represent each dimension. (Not every participant or friend contributes every variable.) Di represents all pairwise interactions between the 13 variables with a 90% or greater completion rate. Choosing 90% as a threshold ensured that every dimension was represented. To the best of our knowledge, exploring the interactions between the dimensions of tie strength is a novel approach. N(i) encodes network structure. It captures the idea that a friendship’s tie strength not only depends on its history, but also on the tie strengths of mutual friends. In other words, it models the idea that a friend who associates with your business acquaintances is different than one who knows your mother, brother and sister.

However, N(i) introduces a dependency: every tie strength now depends on other tie strengths. How can we incorporate the tie strengths of mutual friends when it is tie strength we want to model in the first place? To solve this problem, we fit the equations above using an iterative variation of OLS regression. In each iteration, the tie strengths from the previous round are substituted to calculate N(i), with all si initially set to zero. (Note that N(i) is mostly linear in the predictive variables.) Using this procedure, all si converged in nine iterations (0.001 average relative change threshold). This approach parallels other “neighborhood effect” models [6]. We did not standardize, or “ipsatize” [9], the dependent variables. Because we employed network subsampling, we could not be sure participants saw the Facebook friend they would rate highest or lowest. Furthermore, not all real-life friends have Facebook accounts. It is reasonable to assume that some participants would reserve the ends of the spectra for people our experiment would never turn up. Finally, to account for the violations of normality exhibited by the distributions in Table 1, every variable is log-transformed.",

To roughly adjust for it, all of the results presented here cut the degrees of freedom in half, a technique borrowed from the social networks literature [33]. On the first tie strength question, How strong is your relationship with this person?, the model fits the data very well: Adj. R2 = 0.534, p < 0.001. It achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0994 on a continuous 0–1 scale, where 0 is weakest and 1 is strongest. In other words, on average the model predicts tie strength within one-tenth of its true value. This error interval tightens near the ends of the continuum because predictions are capped between 0 and 1. In addition, we found strong evidence of four dimension interactions (p < 0.001): Intimacy × Structural, F1,971 = 12.37; Social Distance × Structural, F1,971 = 34; Reciprocal Services × Reciprocal Services, F1,971 = 14.4; Structural × Structural, F1,971 = 12.41. As we demonstrate shortly, the Structural dimension plays a minor role as a linear factor. However, it has an important modulating role via these interactions. One way to read this result is that individual relationships matter, but they get filtered through a friend’s clique before impacting tie strength. Figure 2 summarizes the model’s performance on all five tie strength questions, broken down by the model’s three main terms. Modeling dimension interactions boosts performance significantly, with smaller gains associated with modeling network structure. The model fits the second tie strength question as well as the first: How would you feel",

Therefore, we chose to prioritize the first question, the most general of the five. With the exception of How helpful would this person be if you were looking for a job?, all dependent variable intercorrelations were above 0.5 (Table 4).

The p-value for Inbox thread depth does not express confidence in its coefficient; it expresses confidence in its utility relative to other variables. (The coefficient confidence is greater than 99.9%.) For example, Inbox thread depth is highly correlated with Inbox intimacy words, resulting in a lower F statistic.

The How strong? model classifies with 87.2% accuracy using this procedure, significantly outperforming the baseline, χ2(1, N = 4368) = 700.9, p < 0.001. (Note that this situation does not require more sophisticated evaluation techniques, like cross-validation, because the model is highly constrained and the threshold is not learned.) Some predictive variables surprised us. For instance, Inbox thread depth negatively (and strongly) affects tie strength. This finding also clashes with existing work. In [41], Whittaker, et al., report that familiarity between Usenet posters increases thread depth. One way to resolve this disparity is to note that there may be a fundamental difference between the completely private threads found on Facebook (essentially a variant of email) and Usenet’s completely public ones. Common ground theory [7] would suggest that strong ties can communicate very efficiently because of their shared understanding, perhaps manifesting as shorter Inbox threads. Educational difference also strongly predicts tie strength, with tie strength diminishing as the difference grows. This may have resulted from the university community to which our participants belonged. On the other hand, the result may have something to do with Facebook itself, a community that spread via universities. Some variables we suspected to impact tie strength did not. Number of overlapping networks and Age difference, while intuitively good predictors, made little appreciable difference to tie strength. (β = 0.027, F1,971 = 3.08, p = 0.079 and β = -0.0034, F1,971 = 10.50, p = 0.0012, respectively.) The error analysis interviews illustrate the inherent complexity of some relationships. They also point the way toward future research. A model may never, and perhaps should never, predict some relationships. Wanting to reconnect with an ex-boyfriend comes to mind. Relationships like these have powerful emotions and histories at play. However, it may be possible to make better predictions about relationships like the professor-student one, a strong relationship relative to others like it. Incorporating organizational hierarchy may also improve a system’s ability to reason about relationships like these. Merging deeper network knowledge with data about who extended the friend request also looks promising, as evidenced by the “he friended me” interview.",

The How strong? model predicts tie strength within onetenth of its true value on a continuous 0–1 scale, a resolution probably acceptable for most applications. In other words, discretizing our continuum onto a 10-point Likert scale, the How strong? model would usually miss by at most one point. The Intimacy dimension makes the greatest contribution to tie strength, accounting for 32.8% of the model’s predictive capacity. This parallels Marsden’s finding that emotional closeness best reflects tie strength [33]. However, the Intensity dimension also contributes substantially to the model, contrasting with Marsden’s finding that Intensity has significant drawbacks as a predictor. One way to explain this discrepancy is that the sheer number of people available through social media strengthens Intensity as a predictor. In other words, when you choose to interact with someone over and over despite hundreds of people from which to choose, it significantly informs tie strength. The number of variables representing each dimension also plays a role in its overall impact. For example, Emotional Support might impact tie strength more if more variables represented it. (Emotional Support is particularly hard to quantify.) However, more variables does not always equal greater impact. As Duration illustrates, a single variable can account for a large part of the model’s predictive capacity. Some applications will not need 10-point resolution; the coarse categories of strong and weak may suffice. In “The Strength of Weak Ties,” Granovetter himself performs his analytic work with only these approximate distinctions. One way to accomplish this is to use the model’s mean, classifying all friends above it as strong and all below it as weak. Correct predictions are those where the participant’s rating",

The approach would not help users set privacy levels for brand new friends, ones with whom there is no interaction history.

Because strongly tied friends often reconcile their interests [17], a politician might look for new supporters among the strong ties of an existing one. Limiting the message’s audience in this way may increase the success rate relative to the effort expended. Social media has recently started suggesting new friends to users. However, sometimes we choose not to friend someone with good reason. For instance, a strong tie of a strong tie is not necessarily a friend at all: consider the beloved cousin of a best friend. Granovetter writes, “if strong ties A–B and A–C exist, and if B and C are aware of one another, anything short of a positive tie would introduce a ‘psychological strain’ into the situation” [17]. A system that understands tie strength might avoid “strain” by steering clear of these delicate situations. In fact, weak ties of existing friends may make better friend candidates, as it is less likely that users have already declined to friend them. More broadly, systems that understand tie strength might apply it to make better friend introductions, although deeper study would need to uncover how best to use it in this context. Recent work suggests that the average number of social media friends continues to grow, currently above 300 [25]. With users keeping so many friends, social media has started to consolidate friend activity into a single stream. Facebook calls this the Newsfeed. However, the multiplicative nature of the types of friends crossed with the types of updates, e.g., photos, status, new friends, comments, etc., presents a difficult design problem. A system that prioritizes via tie strength, or allows users to tune parameters that incorporate tie strength, might provide more useful, timely and enjoyable activity streams.",

We believe our work makes three important contributions to existing theory. First, we defined the importance of the dimensions of tie strength as manifested in social media. This is novel especially in light of the fact that these weights do not always align with prior work. Second, we showed that tie strength can be modeled as a continuous value. Third, our findings reveal how the Structural dimension modulates other dimensions by filtering individual relationships through cliques. Previously, it was not well-understood how or if tie strength dimensions interacted. Finally, we see a home for our results in social network analysis.

SCADS thus indicates plausible sources of young children's surprising competence at strategy choice and strategy discovery.",

                "text": "Abstract-Preschoolers show surprising competence in choosing adaptively among alternative strategies and in discovering new approaches. The SCADS computer simulation illustrates how simple processes can generate this impressive competence. The model's behavior parallels data on children's addition in at least eight ways: It uses diverse strategies over prolonged periods of time, makes adaptive choices among strategies, discovers the same strategies as children, discovers strategies in the same sequence as children, makes discoveries without trial and error, makes discoveries without having experienced failure, narrowly generalizes new approaches, and generalizes more broadly following challenging problems. SCADS thus indicates plausible sources of young children's surprising competence at strategy choice and strategy discovery. In the past 20 years, developmental psychologists have uncovered many surprising competencies in infants and young children. However, detailed understanding of the processes that give rise to these competencies is almost entirely lacking. In the present article, we present a simulation model, SCADS, that illustrates how relatively simple processes can generate two of the most striking and omnipresent of children's early capabilities: making adaptive choices among existing strategies and discovering useful new strategies. Piagetian theories, neo-Piagetian theories, privileged-domains theories, and information-processing theories all have depicted children's thinking in quite monolithic terms. Children of a given age are portrayed as ordinarily thinking about a given concept or problem in a given way. Multiple understandings or multiple strategies are said to be present only during relatively brief periods of cognitive conflict or disequilibrium. Recent research that has examined children's thinking on a trialby-trial basis, however, has revealed much greater variability than these theories imply. This variability has been reported in domains as diverse as infants' locomotor procedures (Adolph, 1997), preschoolers' attentional strategies (Miller & Aloise-Young, 1996), elementary school children's conceptual understanding (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992), and adolescents' and adults' scientific reasoning (Kuhn, Garcia-Mila, Zohar, & Andersen, 1995; Schauble, 1996). These careful examinations of performance have shown that even on tasks that are often cited as classic illustrations of discontinuous change, children use a variety of approaches, both before and after the hypothesized discontinuity. For example, sustained variability has been observed in children's thinking about number conservation (Church & Goldin-Meadow, 1986), moral reasoning (Colby, Kohlberg, Gibbs, & Lieberman, 1983), serial recall (McGilly & Siegler, 1989), and syntactic development (\" -ed \"  and \" -s \"  overgeneralizations; Marcus et al., 1992).

                "text": "general, superior new approaches only gradually replace less effective older ones. The overlapping-waves model (Siegler, 1996) provides a characterization of development that is more consistent with the data than are the traditional portrayals of development. As illustrated in Figure 1a, the overlapping-waves model depicts children as using multiple approaches for prolonged periods of time. The general direction of development is toward greater use of the more advanced approaches (those with higher numbers in Fig. 1a). New approaches are often discovered and added to the repertoire (Strategies 3, 4, and 5). An example of the empirical data that have given rise to the overlapping-waves formulation is provided in Figure 1b. Being capable of diverse ways of thinking creates a need for children (and adults) to choose which approach to use on a given occasion. From infancy onward, people make these choices in adaptive ways. To cite one example, the steeper the ramp down which infants must descend, the more likely they are to use conservative approaches, such as sliding on their bellies, rather than riskier ones, such as walking (Adolph, 1997). To cite another example, the more difficult the arithmetic problem that preschoolers must solve, the more likely they are to put up their fingers and count them, rather than stating an answer retrieved from memory (Siegler, 1987). The pervasive cognitive variability that has been observed has a further implication: Children must frequently discover new strategies. For example, the fact that the majority of the 4- and 5-year-olds in Siegler and Jenkins (1989) used at least six addition strategies indicates that they had acquired at least that many approaches in the roughly 1-year period in which they had been adding. Similarly, Adolph (1997) reported that all of the infants in her study used all six of the locomotor strategies that she identified for going down slopes. And these are lower limits on the number of strategies generated, because some strategies are short-lived and may have come and gone by the time of the experiment or may not have been selected to solve the particular problems that were presented. Thus, frequent generation of new approaches, like adaptive choices among existing ones, seems a basic characteristic of development. Several computer simulations have been formulated to illustrate how specific cognitive processes could work together to produce strategic development. Each of these models has been limited in important ways, however. Some have generated adaptive choices among strategies and gradually increasing use of more advanced strategies, but they have not discovered new strategies (Siegler & Shipley, 1995; Siegler & Shrager, 1984). Others have shown the exact opposite pattern (Jones & Van Lehn, 1991; Neches, 1987). This dissociation between adaptive choices among existing strategies and discovery of useful new strategies is no coincidence. Discovery of new strategies seems to require quite different representations and learning mechanisms than does changing choices among strategies that are already known. Discovery requires generation of qualitatively novel procedures or concepts, whereas changes in strategy choices require quantitative adjustments in Copyright &copy; 1998 American Psychological Society",

Because of these clear differences, the two types of learning are often viewed as unrelated. In our view, however, adaptive choices among strategies and discovery of new strategies are fundamentally interwoven processes (Crowley, Shrager, & Siegler, 1997). Without multiple prior strategy discoveries, there would be no choices to be made, adaptive or otherwise. Without adaptive choices among available strategies, there would be no point to most strategy discoveries; people would be better off relying consistently on the most effective approach overall. Adaptive strategy choices also produce data that allow new strategies to incorporate lessons learned about the strengths and weaknesses of the most effective existing approaches. Given the pervasiveness of both strategy discovery and strategy choice, and the inherent relation between them, it seems important to integrate the two processes into a unified model of strategic development. This article reports the first such model. The model illustrates how associative and heuristic knowledge work together to produce both of these fundamental functions. We first describe eight central empirical phenomena in a domain in which strategic development has been extensively studied, the development of simple addition strategies. Then we present the new model and describe how it reproduces these eight phenomena.",

                "text": "CHILDREN'S DISCOVERY OF THE MIN STRATEGY Children's arithmetic has been a focal task for research on strategy development over the past three decades (e.g., Ashcraft, 1982; Fuson, 1988; Geary, 1994; Groen & Parkman, 1972). A detailed database on 4- and 5-year-olds' discovery of new strategies in this domain (Siegler & Jenkins, 1989) focused on discovery of the min strategy (counting from the larger addend, as when solving 3 + 5 by counting \" 6, 7, 8 \" ). Preschoolers who knew how to add, but who did not know the min strategy, were given 11 weeks of practice solving addition problems. During this period, the children participated in roughly three sessions per week, with seven problems presented per session. Strategy use was assessed on each trial through a combination of videotapes of overt behavior and asking children immediately after each trial, \" How did you solve that problem? \"  The main findings were as follows: 1. Most 4- and 5-year-olds use at least six strategies, the most common of which are described in Table 1. 2. Children choose adaptively among strategies; they use each approach most often on the types of problems on which that approach is most effective relative to available alternatives. 3. Given practice solving simple addition problems, most 4- and 5year-olds discover the min strategy. 4. Discovery of the shortcut sum strategy appears to play a transitional role in discovery of the min strategy. Most children generate it shortly before they discover the min strategy, and it incorporates aspects of both the already-known sum strategy and the soon-to-be-discovered min strategy (Table 1). 5. Discoveries of new strategies often occur without prior failure. They take place following correct answers as well as following errors. They also take place on easy as well as hard problems.

                "text": "6. Generalization proceeds slowly. After discovering the min strategy (i.e., using it for the first time), children only gradually increase its use. 7. For children who have already discovered the min strategy, generalization increases greatly with presentation of \" challenge problems. \"  These are problems such as 2 + 21, easy to solve via the min strategy, but almost impossible to solve via counting from 1 or retrieval. 8. Finally, discovery does not require trial and error. Almost everyone's commonsense view of discovery, reflected in numerous formal models (e.g., Newell, 1990; Van Lehn, 1990), is that people initially try a mix of legitimate and flawed new strategies, and then winnow out the flawed approaches. However, trial-by-trial examination of Siegler and Jenkins's data revealed that children generate useful new strategies without ever trying conceptually flawed approaches, such as counting the first addend twice. A previous computational model of strategy choice, ASCM (Siegler & Shipley, 1995), generated changes with experience that paralleled changes in children's strategy choices. ASCM learned by associating each problem with answers stated on that problem, and by continually adjusting the strengths of alternative strategies for solving such problems in accord with the relative speeds and accuracies they produced on the problems. Such associative learning produced increasing speed and accuracy, increasingly frequent choices of the more advanced strategies, adaptive generalization to novel problems, and individual differences patterns that mirrored those of children. However, the associative-learning mechanism did not allow discovery of new strategies, a serious shortcoming given the prominence of strategy discovery in this and many other domains. Our new model resolves this problem by including metacognitive as well as associative-learning mechanisms, thereby allowing discovery of novel strategies as well as increasingly adaptive choices among existing ones.",

                "text": "Modeling Children's Strategy Choices and Discoveries THE SIMULATION'S STRUCTURE The new model, called SCADS (Strategy Choice And Discovery Simulation), is schematically outlined in Figure 2. It maintains all of the mechanisms of ASCM but extends it in three ways. First, whereas ASCM represents each strategy as a unit, SCADS represents each strategy as a modular sequence of operators. For example, the sum strategy (Table 1) is represented as the following set of operators: ALL FINGERS DOWN, CHOOSE HAND, CHOOSE ADDEND, SAY ADDEND, CLEAR ECHOIC BUFFER, COUNT OUT FINGERS TO REPRESENT ADDEND, SWITCH HANDS, SWITCH ADDENDS, SAY ADDEND, CLEAR ECHOIC BUFFER, COUNT OUT FINGERS TO REPRESENT ADDEND, CLEAR ECHOIC BUFFER, COUNT ALL FINGERS, END. Second, whereas ASCM recorded only basic statistics about speed and accuracy of strategies, SCADS also forms a working memory trace of each strategy's execution. During and immediately after execution of a strategy, the operations and partial results produced during its execution are available for analysis. The modular representations of strategies and working memory traces of their operation work together with a third new feature of SCADS to generate discoveries. This third feature is a metacognitive system, which analyzes the sequence of operators used to execute existing strategies, identifies potential improvements, and generates new strategies by recombining operators from existing approaches. SCADS's metacognitive system is itself composed of three components: the attentional spotlight, strategy-change heuristics, and goalsketch filters. The attentional spotlight increases the resources devoted to execution of poorly learned strategies. Its operation is analogous to the way in which people focus attention on execution of unpracticed procedures in order to increase the likelihood of executing them correctly. The decision of whether to devote attentional resources to supervising execution of a given operator is based on the current strength of that operator relative to a threshold that varies randomly from trial to trial. Because each operator is at first quite weak, attentional resources are initially required to ensure its appropriate execution. The more often an operator is used, the less often attention will need to be focused on its execution and the more often attentional resources can be devoted to discovering new strategies. As attentional resources are freed, the model allocates them to the strategy-change heuristics, the second component of the metacognitive system. These heuristics operate on the traces of the cognitive operations that were used to solve particular problems. SCADS includes two strategy-change heuristics: (a) If a redundant sequence of behavior is detected, then delete one of the two sets of operators that caused the redundancy; and (b) if statistics on a strategy's speed and accuracy show greater success when the strategy is executed in a particular order, then create a version of the strategy that always uses that order (as opposed to the initial procedure of arbitrarily choosing which addend to quantify first). These heuristics enable the metacognitive system to propose a variety of strategies, some valid, others flawed. An example of a flawed strategy is \" count the first addend twice. \"  To help SCADS avoid executing invalid strategies, the metacognitive system includes a third component, the goal-sketch filters. These are two standards that are essential for legitimate addition strategies and that therefore provide criteria against which proposed new strategies can be evaluated. One filter requires that both addends be represented; the other requires that the reported result include the representations corresponding to both addends. Each of these features of SCADS is consistent with current knowledge about 4- and 5-year-olds' thinking. Children of this age form working memory traces of their execution of strategies, which allow them to provide accurate immediately retrospective verbal reports concerning their strategy use (Siegler, 1987). Like older children and adults, they represent new strategies as sequences of discrete components, as indicated by their fairly often omitting one or another component when they first use a strategy (Miller & Aloise-Young, 1996). They also possess sufficient metacognitive capacity to monitor simple strategies and evaluate them (e.g., one 4-year-old's explanation of why, when presented 6 + 3, she had counted from 6 rather than 1: \" 'Cause then you don't have to count all of those numbers \" ; Siegler & Jenkins, 1989, p. 66). Focused attention enhances both performance and learning from infancy onward (Ruff & Rothbart, 1996). Similarly, children as young as 13 months eliminate redundant actions as they gain experience solving a problem (Chen, Sanchez, & Campbell, 1997). Finally, 5-year-olds who do not yet employ the min strategy use knowledge akin to the goal-sketch filters to evaluate potential addition strategies. They judge the min strategy, which conforms to the standards embodied in the goal-sketch filters, as much smarter than an illegal strategy, which violates the standards (Siegler & Crowley, 1994).",

                "text": "Jeff Shrager and Robert S. Siegler learning. SCADS begins each run with two strategies: retrieval and the sum strategy (putting up fingers and counting them). Retrieval is a basic cognitive capability, present from infancy; the sum strategy is explicitly taught to young children by their parents and is the first strategy specific to arithmetic that most children learn (Saxe, Guberman, & Gearhart, 1987). When an addition problem is presented, the ASCM-like component of SCADS (the part corresponding to the three dotted squares at the top of Fig. 2) chooses a strategy in the same way as in ASCM. At first, the sum strategy is often chosen, because answers are not associated with problems sufficiently strongly to allow the answers to be retrieved and stated. On these initial trials, the metacognitive system consistently decides that attentional resources are needed to supervise execution of the sum strategy, because the operators within it have little strength. On the run being described, once SCADS had solved about 70 problems, enough attentional resources had been freed for the system to begin discovering new strategies. The first three strategies that it proposed violated the goal sketch, and therefore were not tried. For example, one proposed strategy did not include raising fingers corresponding to the second addend and thus violated the goal-sketch filter that requires both addends to be represented. On Problem 82, SCADS discovered a legitimate but inefficient strategy: representing both addends, starting over and doing the same thing, and then advancing the answer yielded by the second execution. This strategy was added to SCADS's repertoire, because it did not violate the goal sketch, but its inefficiency led to it never being used much. A few problems later, the simulation generated a strategy in which the larger addend was always represented first. Thus, 2 + 4, as well as 4 + 2, was solved by counting \" 1, 2, 3, 4, \"  then \" 1, 2, \"  and finally \" 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. \"  This change had only a small effect on performance initially, but provided one of the bases for the min strategy. Later still, SCADS noticed and eliminated part of the redundant processing involved in the sum strategy and generated the shortcut sum strategy. On 4 + 2, the shortcut sum strategy involves only counting \" 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. \"  Finally, SCADS eliminated the redundancy of the shortcut sum strategy's initial count from 1 by just saying the larger addend to represent its quantity. This last discovery, on top of the previous ones, produced the min strategy, which solves 4 + 2 by simply saying, \" 5, 6. \"  To test the degree to which SCADS produces strategy choices and discoveries like those of children, we ran the model 30 times. On each run, the model was presented 500 problems (20 presentations of each of the 25 addition problems with addends 1 through 5). The reason we conducted multiple runs was that the presence of several probabilistic functions in the model led to its results varying somewhat from run to run. The most important probabilistic components were the 4% probability of making an error on any given counting operation, the 5% probability of trying to discover a new strategy on trials when sufficient metacognitive resources are available, and the range from 0 to 1 for the confidence criterion (a randomly varying threshold for stating a retrieved answer). These values were chosen for being in the general range that would generate behavior like that seen in children. No efforts were made to optimize the values to produce the best possible fit to children's performance, because the likelihood of capitalizing on chance was too great. The model demonstrated all seven of the major phenomena of strategy choice and strategy discovery that could be observed in the absence of challenge problems: It used multiple strategies throughout its run (Fig. 1c). It chose adaptively among the strategies. It discovered VOL. 9, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 1998 Downloaded from pss.sagepub.com at Stanford University Libraries on September 12, 2013",

Its discoveries followed correct as well as incorrect performance. It was slow to generalize newly discovered strategies. It never executed illegal strategies. On the 30 individual runs, SCADS proposed between 15 and 21 strategies. Most were vetoed by the goal-sketch filters, and therefore were not used. In addition to the 5 strategies described in Table 1, between 1 and 4 other strategies were passed by the goal-sketch filters on each run. These were legal but inefficient strategies, some of which have been observed in children's addition as well. For example, SCADS, like preschoolers, occasionally executes the sum strategy, obtains an answer, and then executes it again. SCADS's strategy choices were adaptive in the same ways as children's. As is true in the case of children's choices, the easier the problem, as indicated by percentage correct on it, the more often the model used retrieval to generate the answer. Also as with children, the adaptiveness of SCADS's strategy choices increased steadily with experience. Averaged over the 30 runs on which no challenge problems were presented, the correlations between percentage correct on each problem and percentage use of retrieval on the problem rose from r = .38 after 100 trials to r = .91 after 500. SCADS also provided concrete support for the view that the shortcut sum is transitional to the min strategy. The shortcut sum strategy was consistently discovered before the min strategy and made two contributions toward making the latter discovery possible. First, it showed how correct answers could be generated by counting objects only once. Second, it provided data from which the model could learn that starting with the larger addend was more effective than starting with the smaller one. In many runs, these data gave rise to a specialized version of the shortcut sum strategy in which the larger addend was always represented first. Both contributions facilitated discovery of the min strategy. Finally, we tested whether SCADS would also generate the eighth phenomenon-increased generalization of the min strategy following presentation of challenge problems. We ran SCADS 30 additional times. On each run, we replaced one block of 50 standard problems with a block of 50 challenge problems (problems with one addend above 20 and the other below 5, such as 3 + 25 and 25 + 3). This block of challenge problems began 50 trials after discovery of the min strategy. Comparison of SCADS's performance on these 30 runs with its performance on the original 30 showed that presentation of challenge problems had enduring effects on generalization of the newly discovered strategy. Use of the min strategy increased substantially when the challenge problems were presented, and remained higher afterward when the original set of small-addend problems was again presented. A repeated measures analysis of variance yielded the significant interaction between trial block and presentation of challenge problems implied by this description. Percentage use of the min strategy did not differ before the challenge problems were presented, but during their presentation and afterward, use of the min strategy was greater on the runs that included the challenge problems. Other aspects of SCADS's performance were also consistent with data on children's arithmetic. Accuracy improved with experience, rising from 74% correct on the first 25 trials to 90% correct on the last 25. Use of retrieval increased from 53% on the first 25 trials to 87% on the last 25. Mean number of trials before discovery of the min strategy, 107 (SE = 15.7), resembled that of the 4- and 5-year-olds in the Siegler and Jenkins (1989) study, who on average discovered the strategy after 95 trials. The close numerical similarity may be coinciden-",

These results indicate that the combination of associative and metacognitive processes embodied in SCADS is sufficient to generate both adaptive choices among existing strategies and discovery of new strategies. Important challenges remain, including modeling how children acquire their initial (sum) strategy from parental instruction, showing how discoveries are made when relevant components are not present in any existing strategy, and demonstrating the applicability of SCADS to modeling strategic development in other domains. However, we do not wish to minimize what SCADS has already accomplished. It produces the combination of qualitative novelties and slowly changing distributions of existing approaches that marks children's strategic development. It also generates a large number of particular phenomena that closely parallel the growth of children's arithmetic skills. Previous models of strategy discovery that were based solely on metacognitive mechanisms or solely on associative mechanisms were unable to generate this combination of quantitative and qualitative change. Thus, the model suggests that both metacognitive mechanisms, which can produce qualitative novelties, and associative mechanisms, which produce gradual learning, are essential to strategic development. More generally, SCADS illustrates how relatively simple, nonspecialized processes can give rise to at least some of young children's impressive cognitive competence.
