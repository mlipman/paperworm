					Everyone,

					For class on Nov 19, the primary reading is a paper by Koedinger &amp; Anderson (1990) in which the offer an analysis of expert reasoning in Geometry.  The paper argues that earlier models, which approached proof in geometry as proceeding at the level of the formal steps required to get from premises to the desired result, fail to capture the actual process by which experts reason about Geometry proof problems.  They offer an alternative based on what they call the diagram configuration model, which takes a very different approach.  My goal for the session is for us to, first, understand the diagram configuration model and, second, to understand its implications for understanding how geometry should be learned -- and taught.

					To complement the primary reading, please read the article by Shaughnessy &amp; Burger (1985).  I just uploaded this a few minutes ago, and I suggest you read this instead of the Burger &amp; Shaughnessy (1986) article on the syllabus since it is shorter while presenting important background and implications more clearly (if however, you have already read the other one, that will be sufficient, since they cover the same material).  These articles present a description of aspects of geometry knowledge and reasoning based on the ideas of two Dutch researchers (van Hiele &amp; van Hiele).  The van Heile's noted that children progress from very concrete and unsystematic approaches to geometry to more systematic and more formal approaches, characterizing a series of levels.  Shaughnessy &amp; Burger argue that the levels are useful, but that many students fail to progress to more advanced levels, and also that individuals are not consistent in the levels the use.  They introduce a very interesting idea that students and teachers may 'confront a level' in a geometry class -- that is, that students and teachers are working at different levels and will not be able to properly understand each other.

					In your comments for the Forum, I welcome discussion primarily of the Koedinger &amp; Anderson model.  This discussion might take the form of

					 -- a critical assessment of the features of the model and/or its adequacy to account for the expert problem solving protocol data they present;

					 -- relating this model to earlier themes of the class, such as the role of visuospatial abilities and/or the selection of strategies for mathematical problem solving

					 -- relating comparing and contrasting Koedinger and Anderson's approach to the ideas presented in Shaughnessy and Burger

					 -- commenting on their discussion of the implications of their analysis for teaching and learning of geometry.
