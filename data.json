			"abstract":"Preschoolers show surprising competence in choosing adaptively among alternative strategies and in discovering new approaches. The SCADS computer simulation illustrates how simple processes can generate this impressive competence. The model's behavior parallels data on children's addition in at least eight ways: It uses diverse strategies over prolonged periods of time, makes adaptive choices among strategies, discovers the same strategies as children, discovers strategies in the same sequence as children, makes discoveries without trial and error, makes discoveries without having experienced failure, narrowly generalizes new approaches, and generalizes more broadly following challenging problems. SCADS thus indicates plausible sources of young children's surprising competence at strategy choice and strategy discovery.",

				"body":"These articles present a description of aspects of geometry knowledge and reasoning based on the ideas of two Dutch researchers (van Hiele and van Hiele).  The van Heile's noted that children progress from very concrete and unsystematic approaches to geometry to more systematic and more formal approaches, characterizing a series of levels.  Shaughnessy and Burger argue that the levels are useful, but that many students fail to progress to more advanced levels, and also that individuals are not consistent in the levels the use.  They introduce a very interesting idea that students and teachers may 'confront a level' in a geometry class -- that is, that students and teachers are working at different levels and will not be able to properly understand each other."

				"body":"For class on Nov 19, the primary reading is a paper by Koedinger and Anderson (1990) in which the offer an analysis of expert reasoning in Geometry.  The paper argues that earlier models, which approached proof in geometry as proceeding at the level of the formal steps required to get from premises to the desired result, fail to capture the actual process by which experts reason about Geometry proof problems.  They offer an alternative based on what they call the diagram configuration model, which takes a very different approach.  My goal for the session is for us to, first, understand the diagram configuration model and, second, to understand its implications for understanding how geometry should be learned -- and taught."
